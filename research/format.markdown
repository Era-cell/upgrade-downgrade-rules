# Research on `format` keyword 
Changes in `format` Keyword Behaviour Across all JSON Schema Drafts: Additions, Deletions, and Upgrades.

## Draft 0 to Draft 2 (No changes)

## Draft 2 to Draft 3

)

> Behaviour:

      b. they SHOULD offer an option to disable validation for this keyword.  
      c. Implementations MAY add custom format attributes but not peer implementations.

## Draft 7 to 2019-09

References: [Draft 7](https://json-schema.org/draft-07/draft-handrews-json-schema-validation-01#rfc.section.7), [2019-09](https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-09/draft-handrews-json-schema-validation-02#rfc.section.7)

> Behaviour: 
      >>[Before](https://json-schema.org/draft-07/draft-handrews-json-schema-validation-01#rfc.section.7.2): They SHOULD implement validation, they SHOULD offer an option to disable validation for this keyword.  
      [After](https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-09/draft-handrews-json-schema-validation-02#rfc.section.7.2): The `format` keyword functions as an annotation, and optionally as an assertion. Also, when treating values as annotations unknown formats SHOULD be collected as annotations.

| Change Type | Format Attribute | Description |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|
| Added       | `duration`         | A string instance is valid against this attribute if it is a valid representation according to the `duration` production |
| Added       | `uuid`             | A string instance is valid against this attribute if it is a valid string representation of a UUID, according to [RFC4122](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt) |

## 2019-09 to 2020-12

References: [2019-09](https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-09/draft-handrews-json-schema-validation-02#rfc.section.7), [2020-12](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/draft-bhutton-json-schema-validation-01#section-7)

> Behaviour: 
      >>[Before](https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-09/draft-handrews-json-schema-validation-02#rfc.section.7.2.3): An implementation MUST NOT fail validation or cease processing due to an unknown format attribute.  
      [After](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/draft-bhutton-json-schema-validation-01#section-7.2.3): When the Format-Assertion vocabulary is specified, implementations MUST fail upon encountering unknown formats.
